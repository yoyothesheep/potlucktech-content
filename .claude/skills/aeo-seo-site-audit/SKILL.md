# AEO & Content Analysis Skill (Ahrefs Complement)

This skill analyzes content quality, JSON-LD schema validation, and AEO (Answer Engine Optimization) for pages you specify. It complements Ahrefs Site Audit (which handles technical SEO) by focusing on aspects that require content analysis and AI-readiness assessment.

**Use this skill when Ahrefs Site Audit cannot:**
- Validate JSON-LD schema completeness and correctness
- Assess content quality and depth
- Evaluate how well pages answer user questions directly
- Identify authority/expertise signals
- Recommend AI-friendly content restructuring
- Assess natural language optimization
- Flag citability gaps

## When to Use This Skill

Trigger this skill when the user:
- Has run an Ahrefs Site Audit and wants to go deeper on content
- Asks "why isn't my content ranking for [query]?"
- Wants to "optimize for AI search" or "ChatGPT search"
- Asks "how do I get cited by AI" or "appear in AI overviews"
- Wants to "improve schema markup for content types"
- Asks "how can I make my content more AI-friendly?"
- Wants "content quality analysis" beyond technical SEO

## Core Workflow

Steps 1-2. **[Coordinator]** Gather Input — get URLs, Ahrefs project ID (optional), business context
Steps 3-5. **[Haiku Agent, parallel per URL]** Fetch Ahrefs data (if provided) + crawl pages + extract all raw signals
Steps 6-11. **[Sonnet Agent]** Validate schema, analyze content quality, assess authority, prioritize gaps, generate report

## Agent Architecture

### Coordinator (main Claude)
Handles Steps 1–2: gathers user input and orchestrates the two agents. Passes URLs + Ahrefs project ID to the Haiku agent(s), then passes all Haiku output payloads to the Sonnet agent.

### Haiku Research Agents
- One agent per URL, launched in parallel
- One additional agent for the Ahrefs API call (if project ID provided)
- Job: mechanical data extraction only — no analysis or judgment
- Output: structured JSON payload per URL (see Haiku Output Contract section below)

### Sonnet Synthesis Agent
- Single agent, runs after all Haiku agents complete
- Receives all Haiku JSON payloads + Ahrefs data
- Job: schema validation, content analysis, gap prioritization, report writing
- Output: final report
---

## Environment Detection

Before starting the audit, check which tools are available and adjust accordingly:

| Environment | Tools Available | Schema Inspection | JSON-LD Extraction Method |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code** (CLI) | `Bash`, `WebFetch`, file I/O | ✅ Full | Use `curl + grep` or Python to extract from raw HTML |
| **Claude Web** | `WebFetch` only | ⚠️ Partial (stripped) | Use `strings` from curl or ask user for Rich Results Test output |

**Note:** JSON-LD extraction is NOT optional. Audits claiming "no schema found" without explicit JSON-LD extraction attempts are incomplete and inaccurate. Always verify schema presence before reporting it as missing.

## Critical: Distinguish "Crawlable" from "Indexable"

⚠️ **Modern Googlebot executes JavaScript.** A site with empty static HTML (SPA, client-side rendering) may still be indexed by Google. The presence of a `<div id="root"></div>` does NOT mean the site is "not indexed."

**Crawlable** = Static HTML contains content (good for all crawlers, fastest for Googlebot)
**Indexable** = Google can find and index the content (true even if JS-rendered; Googlebot waits for JS execution)
**Optimal for AI crawlers** = Static HTML with schema markup (most AI answer engines have limited JS execution)

**Do not conclude a site is "not indexed" based solely on static HTML analysis.** Always verify actual indexing status first (see Step 1 below).

---

## COORDINATOR

## Step 1: Gather Input & Verify Indexing Status

Ask the user for:

**Required:**
- **Target URLs or Local Files**: The pages or codebase files to analyze.
  - If user provides live URLs: Proceed with the multi-agent web crawling in Steps 2-6.
  - If user asks you to audit a local codebase (e.g., within Claude Code): **Skip Steps 2 through 6**. Use your file reading tools to inspect the source files directly, extract schema/structure, and begin your evaluation directly at **Step 7**.

**⚠️ Before proceeding, verify actual Google indexing status:**

If user reports the site is "not indexed":
1. Ask: "Have you checked Google Search Console coverage report?" or "Have you tried `site:yourdomain.com` in Google search?"
2. If uncertain, recommend they verify using:
   - Google Search Console (Coverage > Indexed pages)
   - `site:yourdomain.com` search operator
   - Google's URL Inspection tool (one specific URL)
3. **Do not assume** a site is unindexed based on static HTML analysis alone. Modern Googlebot executes JavaScript and can index SPAs.
4. If the site is actually indexed, note this in the report's findings — the audit focus shifts to crawlability, AI-friendliness, and schema optimization (not indexing recovery).

**Optional:**
- **Ahrefs Project ID** (recommended): If you have Ahrefs Site Audit set up, provide the project ID
  - Skill will automatically fetch technical audit findings (titles, H1s, broken links, crawl issues, etc.)
  - Report combines Ahrefs technical findings + this skill's content/AEO analysis
  - No need to manually export/attach CSV—we pull directly from Ahrefs API
- **Business context**: What does the site do? What keywords/topics matter most?
- **Content goals**: Are you targeting AI search engines (ChatGPT, Perplexity, AI Overviews)?
- **Current pain points**: "Content not ranking well" / "Low AI citations" / "Thin content" etc.

**Note:** This skill complements Ahrefs Site Audit (which checks titles, meta descriptions, H1 tags, broken links, etc.). Focus here is content depth, schema, and AEO.

## Step 2: Orchestrate Agents

After gathering input, launch Haiku agents in parallel using the Task tool — one per URL, plus one for the Ahrefs API call if a project ID was provided. Do not wait for one to finish before launching the next.

```
For each URL in target_urls:
  Task(
    subagent_type: "general-purpose",
    model: "haiku",
    prompt: <full HAIKU AGENT instructions below> + "\n\nURL to process: {url}"
  )

If ahrefs_project_id provided:
  Task(
    subagent_type: "general-purpose",
    model: "haiku",
    prompt: <Step 3 instructions> + "\n\nProject ID: {ahrefs_project_id}"
  )
```

Collect all Task results. Once every Haiku agent has returned its JSON payload, proceed to the SONNET AGENT section.

---

## HAIKU AGENT

## Step 3: Fetch Ahrefs Audit Issues (Optional)

If user provided an Ahrefs project ID, pull technical audit findings:

```python
# Use Ahrefs MCP to fetch Site Audit issues
ahrefs_issues = site_audit_issues(
    project_id=user_project_id,
    date=None  # Get latest crawl
)

# Parse issues by type:
# - Title/meta description issues
# - H1/heading hierarchy issues
# - Broken links
# - Mobile optimization issues
# - Crawlability issues
# Store for reference in final report
```

**If user doesn't have Ahrefs project ID:**
- Skip this step
- Continue with content-only analysis

---

## Step 4: Crawl Target Pages, Extract JSON-LD & Content Signals

**⚠️ CRITICAL: JSON-LD extraction is mandatory on every page. Do ONE fetch per URL (not two) to ensure efficiency.**

**⚠️ CRITICAL: When analyzing static HTML, distinguish between:**
- **"Empty static HTML" (JS-rendered SPA)**: Does NOT mean "not indexable by Google." Modern Googlebot executes JavaScript. However, it DOES mean poor crawlability for other crawlers (Bingbot, AI answer engines, feed readers).
- **"No content in static HTML"**: Valid finding for crawlability audit. Report it as a crawlability gap, not an indexing problem.

For each target URL, extract all raw signals in a single pass. This step combines fetching, JSON-LD extraction, and content signal extraction.

### Environment Detection & Fetch Strategy

Before fetching, detect which tools are available:

- **Claude Code (Bash available):** Use `curl` to fetch raw HTML, extract JSON-LD and content signals immediately
- **Claude Web (WebFetch only):** Use `web_fetch`, JSON-LD will be stripped during conversion

### Fetch & Extract Implementation

**If `Bash` is available (Claude Code):**
```bash
curl -s "https://example.com" 2>&1 | python3 << 'EOF'
import sys, re, json
html = sys.stdin.read()
# Find all JSON-LD blocks
blocks = re.findall(r'<script[^>]*type=["\']application/ld\+json["\'][^>]*>(.*?)</script>', html, re.DOTALL)
extracted_jsonld = []
if blocks:
  for i, block in enumerate(blocks):
    try:
      data = json.loads(block.strip())
      extracted_jsonld.append(data)
      print(f"=== JSON-LD Block {i+1} ===")
      print(json.dumps(data, indent=2))
    except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
      print(f"Error parsing JSON-LD block {i+1}: {e}")
else:
  print("No JSON-LD found")
EOF
```

**If only `WebFetch` is available (Claude Web):**
```python
result = web_fetch(url, text_content_token_limit=50000)
# Note: JSON-LD is stripped during conversion. Store HTML as-is.
# Extracted schema will be empty; will note limitation in report.
```

### Content Elements to Extract (from stored HTML)

```python
# Parse from stored HTML:
- Total word count of main content
- Paragraph structure and sentence complexity
- Lists (<ul>, <ol>) and tables
- Presence of FAQ sections, direct answers to questions
- Formatting: bold, code blocks, callouts
- Links: internal links, citation links, source attribution
- Images: presence of descriptive captions
```

### Authority & Freshness Signals to Extract (from stored HTML)

```python
# Look for in stored HTML:
- Author information (name, title, credentials)
- Publication date (<meta name="article:published_time"> or datePublished in schema)
- Last updated date (dateModified or "Updated:" text)
- Organization/author credentials or bio
- External citations and source links
```

### Extract Internal Links from Stored HTML

```python
# From stored HTML, extract <a href="..."> where:
- href starts with "/" or contains the same domain
- Not pointing to: #anchors, mailto:, tel:, javascript:, files (.pdf, .jpg, etc.)
- Not duplicate URLs
# Store for optional content sampling (Step 5)
```

---

## Step 5: Required Representative Sampling

To ensure consistent, reproducible findings, crawl at least **2 representative pages per page type** present on the site. This sampling is **required** — not optional. Skipping dynamic or category pages is the most common cause of missed critical findings (CSR rendering gaps, listing schema gaps).

**Page types to identify and sample:**

| Type | Description | Examples |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Static content page | Server-rendered marketing or informational page | Homepage, About, Data Sources, FAQ |
| Dynamic/app route | Page that may require JavaScript to render content | Career detail, product page, quiz/tool |
| Category/listing page | Index of items or content | Blog index, career listings, provider directory |
| Utility/supporting page | Non-primary page with supporting content | Pricing, Contact, Sitemap |

**Sampling rules:**
- Review the user-specified URLs and identify which types are already covered
- For each type **not yet covered**, find and add 1–2 pages of that type (crawl the homepage, check nav links, or follow `href` patterns like `/discover/`, `/blog/`, `/products/`)
- For dynamic pages: fetch with `curl` regardless; if content is missing from raw HTML, that is a finding (CSR gap), not a reason to skip
- Maximum 10 additional pages beyond user-specified URLs
- If fetch fails, include the URL with `"error": "..."` — do not omit it

**For each sampled page:** Use Step 4 methodology (environment-aware fetch + JSON-LD extraction + content signal extraction, store HTML for parsing).

---

## Haiku Output Contract

Each Haiku agent outputs one JSON payload per URL. This is the only data the Sonnet agent receives — it never accesses raw HTML.

```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com/page",
  "status_code": 200,
  "fetch_method": "curl",
  "json_ld_blocks": [
    { "@context": "https://schema.org", "@type": "FAQPage", "mainEntity": [...] }
  ],
  "json_ld_extraction_attempted": true,
  "word_count": 847,
  "headings": [
    { "level": "h1", "text": "..." },
    { "level": "h2", "text": "..." }
  ],
  "has_lists": true,
  "has_tables": false,
  "has_code_blocks": false,
  "faq_sections_detected": 2,
  "author_markup_found": true,
  "author_text": "Jane Smith, Senior Editor",
  "date_fields_found": ["datePublished"],
  "date_modified_found": false,
  "external_citation_links": 3,
  "internal_links": ["https://example.com/related-page"],
  "image_count": 4,
  "images_with_captions": 2,
  "ahrefs_issues": [],
  "token_usage": {
    "model": "claude-haiku-4-5-20251001",
    "input_tokens": 0,
    "output_tokens": 0
  }
}
```

**Notes:**
- `json_ld_extraction_attempted` must always be `true` — never report "no schema found" without attempting extraction
- If fetch failed, include `"status_code": null` and `"error": "..."` — do not omit the URL from results
- `ahrefs_issues` is populated only on the Ahrefs agent payload, not per-URL
- `token_usage` must be populated by every Haiku agent. Use the actual token counts from the API response metadata if available; otherwise estimate based on prompt + output length.

---

## SONNET AGENT

The Sonnet agent receives all Haiku JSON payloads and the Ahrefs issues data. It never fetches URLs. All analysis, judgment, and report writing happens here.

**Token tracking:** At the end of your output, include your own token usage:
```json
{
  "sonnet_token_usage": {
    "model": "claude-sonnet-4-6",
    "input_tokens": 0,
    "output_tokens": 0
  }
}
```
Use actual API response metadata if available; otherwise estimate from input/output length.

## Step 6: Schema Validation

**Using JSON-LD blocks from Haiku payloads:**

- Check if schema type matches content type (FAQPage for FAQs, Article for blog posts, etc.)
- Identify missing required fields (author, datePublished, answer properties, etc.)
- Flag schema that doesn't match visible content signals (e.g., FAQPage present but `faq_sections_detected: 0` in payload)

**Do not validate "no schema found" without confirming `json_ld_extraction_attempted: true` in the Haiku payload.**

---

## Step 7: Schema Markup & Structure Validation

Analyze all crawled pages for JSON-LD completeness and AEO readiness:

### Schema Validation (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Missing Schema for Content Type:**
- ❌ FAQ/Q&A content with no `FAQPage` schema
- ❌ Articles with no `Article` or `BlogPosting` schema
- ❌ How-to content with no `HowTo` schema
- ❌ Product pages with no `Product` schema
- ❌ Organization pages with no `Organization` schema
- ❌ Reviews with no `Review` or `AggregateRating` schema
- ✅ Good: Schema matches content type with all required properties

**Incomplete Schema:**
- ❌ `FAQPage` present but missing author, datePublished, or mainEntity
- ❌ `Article` missing datePublished or author information
- ❌ Schema properties incomplete or marked with placeholder values
- ✅ Good: Schema has all required fields + recommended fields (author, date, description)

**Schema Quality:**
- ❌ Schema doesn't match visible content (e.g., FAQPage claims 10 Q&As but page shows 3)
- ❌ Nested schema incorrectly structured (e.g., Answer not properly nested in Question)
- ✅ Good: Schema structure is valid and matches content accurately

### Content Structure for AI (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Direct Answer Formats:**
- ❌ Content doesn't answer main question in first paragraph
- ❌ Answers buried in prose; no clear Q&A or summary
- ✅ Good: First sentence answers the question; FAQ/TL;DR at top

**Scannable Formatting:**
- ❌ Content is all prose; no lists, tables, or visual breaks
- ❌ No numbered steps for how-to content
- ✅ Good: Bulleted lists, comparison tables, numbered steps, short paragraphs

**Topic Coherence:**
- ❌ Content jumps between unrelated subtopics
- ❌ Sections don't connect logically
- ✅ Good: Clear section topics; content flows logically; related pages linked

---

## Step 8: Content Quality and Structure (SEO and AEO)

Evaluate all content for SEO quality and AEO (Answer Engine Optimization)—how well it serves both traditional search engines and AI systems like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google AI Overviews.

### Topic Coverage & Clarity

**User Intent & Comprehensiveness**
- ❌ Content doesn't clearly address the stated topic (from title/H1)
- ❌ Content is too shallow for user intent
- ✅ Good: Comprehensive coverage matching search intent
- ✅ Good: First paragraph directly answers the main question

**Direct Answer Formats (AEO Priority)**
- ❌ Content doesn't answer specific questions directly; answers buried in prose
- ❌ No summary or abstract at the beginning
- ✅ Good: Clear questions as H2/H3 headings with immediate answers
- ✅ Good: Executive summary or TL;DR at top; definitions early in content
- ✅ Good: FAQ sections with explicit Q&A format

### Keyword & Semantic Usage

**Keyword Placement**
- ❌ Target keywords missing or poorly placed
- ✅ Good: Keywords naturally used in title, H1, H2s, and first paragraph
- ✅ Good: Related/semantic keywords present throughout

**Content Originality & Specificity**
- ❌ Generic, thin content; only rehashed information
- ✅ Good: Original research, specific examples, data, or expert analysis
- ✅ Good: Matches user intent (informational vs. commercial vs. transactional)

### Content Structure & Scannability

**Heading Hierarchy & Descriptiveness**
- ❌ Flat structure, generic headings, skipped heading levels
- ✅ Good: Descriptive headings that can stand alone; logical H2 → H3 progression
- ✅ Good: Each section addresses one clear subtopic

**List-Based & Semantic Structure (AEO Priority)**
- ❌ Information only in prose; no lists, comparisons, or checklists
- ❌ Content jumps between unrelated topics
- ✅ Good: Key points in numbered/bulleted lists; comparison tables; checklists
- ✅ Good: Content stays focused; related subtopics logically connected
- ✅ Good: Short paragraphs with varied formatting for scannability

**Schema Markup for AI Extraction (CRITICAL)**
**These are the #1 issues AI systems care about. Verify schema extraction before marking as missing.**

- ❌ **No FAQ schema** on Q&A content (major AEO issue)
- ❌ **No HowTo schema** for step-by-step guides
- ❌ **Missing Article/BlogPosting schema** with author, date, and structure
- ❌ **Missing Organization schema** on homepage
- ❌ **No BreadcrumbList schema** for navigation
- ✅ Good: `FAQPage` schema with complete Q&A pairs
- ✅ Good: `HowTo` schema with `HowToStep` items
- ✅ Good: `Article`/`BlogPosting` with author info and publication dates
- ✅ Good: `Organization`, `BreadcrumbList`, or other relevant schema types

### Authority & Citability (AEO Priority)

**Expertise & Author Signals**
- ❌ No author information, credentials, or expertise signals
- ✅ Good: Author bio with relevant credentials; "Written by [Name], [Title]"
- ✅ Good: Author schema markup

**Source Attribution & Evidence**
- ❌ Claims without sources or supporting links
- ✅ Good: Direct links to original sources and citations
- ✅ Good: "According to [Source], ..." format; statistics and data attributed

**Freshness Indicators**
- ❌ No date information; outdated without update signals
- ✅ Good: Clear publish date and "Last updated: [date]" for freshness
- ✅ Good: datePublished and dateModified in schema; references recent information

### Natural Language Optimization (AEO Priority)

**Conversational & Accessible Language**
- ❌ Overly technical jargon, corporate speak, or fragmented sentences
- ✅ Good: Explains concepts in plain language; answers like a human would
- ✅ Good: Complete sentences with necessary context; can extract any paragraph and it makes sense
- ✅ Good: Uses "you" to address the reader; includes clear definitions

**Topic Coherence**
- ❌ Content jumps between unrelated topics; no clear focus
- ✅ Good: Each section connects logically to others
- ✅ Good: Internal links to related topics on separate pages

### Content Patterns for AI (AEO Priority)

Identify and optimize for AI-friendly formats:

- **How-To Content**: "How to [task]" format, numbered steps, time estimates, prerequisites
- **Comparison Content**: "[X] vs [Y]" titles, side-by-side tables, pros/cons, clear recommendation
- **Definitive Guides**: "Complete Guide" or "Everything You Need to Know" format, table of contents, multi-section coverage
- **Best/Top Lists**: "Best [X] for [Use Case]" format, clear ranking criteria, descriptions with reasoning

### Priority Summary

| Priority | Issue | Impact |
|----------|-------|--------|
| 🔴 Critical | Missing FAQ/HowTo schema on relevant content | Prevents AI extraction; major ranking loss for AEO |
| 🔴 Critical | No author info/expertise signals | Reduces citability; AI systems deprioritize unsourced content |
| 🔴 Critical | Content doesn't directly answer questions | Users and AI skip the page |
| 🔴 Critical | Missing publish/update dates | AI views content as stale |
| 🟡 Important | Only prose (no lists/tables/structure) | Harder for AI to extract; poor scannability |
| 🟡 Important | Generic/non-descriptive headings | AI can't understand section topics |
| 🟡 Important | Missing source citations | Reduces authority; AI won't cite |
| 🟡 Important | Complex language without explanations | Users bounce; AI struggles to extract meaning |
| 🟢 Enhancement | Add comparison/HowTo schema | Improves featured snippets and AI citations |
| 🟢 Enhancement | Improve conversational tone | Increases engagement and AI relevance |
| 🟢 Enhancement | Add specific examples and data | Supports claim substantiation for AI search |

---

## Step 9: Authority & Citability Assessment

Evaluate how well pages establish expertise and enable AI systems to cite the content.

### Author Credibility Signals

**Observable signals:**
- ❌ No author information on any page
- ❌ Author listed but no credentials, title, or bio
- ❌ No author schema markup (Author property in schema)
- ✅ Good: Author name + title/credentials visible; Author schema present

**Impact on AEO:** AI systems check author credibility before citing. Missing author signals = low citability.

### Source Attribution & Citations

**Observable signals:**
- ❌ Claims made without sources or supporting links
- ❌ Statistics cited without attribution ("trusted data" but no link to source)
- ❌ No distinction between original data and curated information
- ✅ Good: Direct links to sources; "According to [Source]" format; statistics attributed
- ✅ Good: Original research/data clearly marked; methodology explained

**Impact on AEO:** AI systems prioritize citing well-sourced content. Direct links increase citability.

### Freshness Indicators

**Observable signals:**
- ❌ No publication or update date visible
- ❌ Outdated information without update signals
- ❌ No datePublished or dateModified in schema
- ✅ Good: Clear "Published [date]" and "Updated [date]" visible
- ✅ Good: datePublished and dateModified in schema; content references recent data

**Impact on AEO:** AI systems deprioritize stale content. Dates signal ongoing relevance.

### Expertise Depth

**Observable signals:**
- ❌ Shallow coverage; content could be written by anyone
- ❌ No evidence of specialized knowledge or experience
- ⚠️ Good domain knowledge but not explicitly stated
- ✅ Good: Domain expertise evident (specific examples, methodology, credentials)
- ✅ Good: Depth of coverage exceeds surface-level information

---

## Step 10: Prioritize Content & AEO Gaps

Group all identified issues into three priority tiers:

### 🔴 High Priority (Critical for AEO)

Issues that significantly impact AI citability and content quality:
- **Missing schema for content type** (e.g., no FAQPage on FAQ content, no Article on blog posts)
- **No author/expertise signals** (missing author name, credentials, or author schema)
- **Content doesn't directly answer main question** (answer buried in prose)
- **Missing publication date** (no datePublished in schema or visible date)
- **Incomplete schema** (FAQPage present but missing required fields like author, question, answer)

### 🟡 Medium Priority (Improves AEO)

Issues that enhance content quality and extractability:
- **Thin content** (<300 words for informational pages; missing depth vs competitors)
- **No source citations** (claims made without supporting links or attribution)
- **Only prose formatting** (no lists, tables, or scannable structure for how-to/comparison content)
- **Missing dateModified** (no update signal for content refresh)
- **Poor topic structure** (content jumps between topics; sections not logically connected)
- **Complex language** (jargon-heavy without explanations; not conversational)

### 🟢 Low Priority (Enhancements)

Nice-to-have improvements:
- **Add comparison/HowTo schema** (improves featured snippets and AI citations)
- **Improve conversational tone** (makes content more readable and extractable)
- **Add specific examples and data** (supports claim substantiation for AI search)
- **Internal linking to related topics** (improves content coherence and crawlability)

For each issue, include:
- **What's wrong**: Clear description (e.g., "FAQ schema incomplete—missing 'answer' field in Q&A pairs")
- **Why it matters**: Specific AEO impact (e.g., "AI systems can't extract answers without complete schema")
- **How to fix**: Specific steps (e.g., "Add 'answer' property to each Q&A item in FAQPage schema")
- **Affected pages**: URLs with this issue
- **Estimated effort**: Quick (<30 min), Moderate (1-3 hours), Major (4+ hours)

---

## Step 11: Generate Content & AEO Report

Create a well-structured document (markdown or docx) with:

### Executive Summary
- **Tone:** Analytical and data-driven (see [TONE-GUIDE.md](../TONE-GUIDE.md))
- Total pages analyzed
- **Google indexing status (if reported as problem):** Clearly state whether actual indexing was verified via GSC/site: operator or if this is based on crawler simulation analysis. Important distinction: "Static HTML shows no crawlable content (gap for non-Google crawlers)" vs. "Not indexed by Google (requires GSC verification)."
- Summary of Ahrefs findings (if available): "Ahrefs identified X technical issues across Y pages"
- Overall AEO readiness score (based on schema, content, authority signals)
- Top 3-5 critical gaps (prioritized by AEO impact and effort)
- Estimated improvement: "With these changes, content will be 40-50% more extractable by AI systems"
- **Total research cost: $—** (one line; full breakdown in Token Usage appendix at end of report)

### Prioritized Recommendations

**Writing style for recommendations:** See [TONE-GUIDE.md](../TONE-GUIDE.md) for detailed style guidelines. Key principles:
- Use neutral language without dramatic framing
- Quantify impact with specific data
- Avoid vague benefits (no "better SEO" without specifics)
- Explain mechanisms and provide realistic effort estimates

**What to include:**
- **All** 🔴 Critical issues and 🟡 Important issues — no cap, no omissions
- **Top 3** 🟢 Enhancement items, selected by highest impact
- If more than 3 enhancements were identified, append: `> _N additional enhancements not listed — see Priority Summary for full list._`

**Priority tiers:**

| Tier | Label | Include |
|---|---|---|
| 🔴 Critical | Blocks ranking or AI citability; fix immediately | All |
| 🟡 Important | Meaningfully reduces performance; fix soon | All |
| 🟢 Enhancement | Incremental improvement; schedule when bandwidth allows | Top 3 |

Order within each tier by impact × effort. Begin with a summary table — one row per recommendation — then list full details for each item below the table.

**Summary table (one row per recommendation):**

| # | Priority | Recommendation | Category | Effort | Pages Affected |
|---|----------|---------------|----------|--------|----------------|
| 1 | 🔴 Critical | … | … | Quick / Moderate / Major | X of Y |
| 2 | 🟡 Important | … | … | … | … |
| … | … | … | … | … | … |

**Detailed recommendations (one section per item, matching table order):**

For each item:

- **What to do**: Specific, actionable instruction with affected page count or URLs
- **Why it matters**: Data-backed impact (e.g., "Affects 8 of 11 pages" / "Missing schema blocks AI extraction")
- **Category**: Technical SEO / Content / AEO / Information Architecture / Content Presentation
- **Effort**: Quick (<30 min) / Moderate (1–3 hrs) / Major (4+ hrs)

### Detailed Findings

**Writing style guidelines:** See [TONE-GUIDE.md](../TONE-GUIDE.md). Key principles:
- State issues factually without editorializing
- Explain specific mechanism of impact
- Use metrics: "3 of 11 pages" not "some pages"
- Distinguish between content quality and schema completeness

#### Schema Markup Gaps
For each page/content type:
- Missing or incomplete schema (e.g., "FAQPage present but 3 of 10 Q&As missing 'answer' field")
- Affected pages (X of Y total)
- Impact on AEO (e.g., "AI systems can't cite answers without complete schema")
- Specific fix (e.g., "Add 'answer' property to all Question items")

#### Content Quality Issues
- Thin content vs competitors (word count, depth analysis)
- Direct answer format gaps (where content buries answers in prose)
- Scannable formatting (lack of lists, tables, sections for how-to/comparison content)
- Authority signal gaps (missing author info, credentials, source citations)
- Freshness signals (missing publication/update dates)

#### AI-Friendly Content Structure Gaps
- Missing FAQ sections on Q&A content
- How-to content without numbered steps or schema
- Comparison content without tables or pros/cons
- General content lacking topic coherence and internal linking

#### Natural Language Optimization
- Complex jargon without explanations
- Conversational tone assessment (readable for AI extraction)
- Paragraph-level extractability (can AI extract any paragraph and understand it alone?)

### Page-by-Page Breakdown
For each analyzed page:
- URL
- Current issues (prioritized)
- Recommended changes
- Current vs recommended title/description examples

### Token Usage

**Pricing reference:**
- Haiku 4.5: $0.80 / 1M input tokens, $4.00 / 1M output tokens

## Important Notes

### Integration with Ahrefs

**If user provides Ahrefs Project ID:**
- Call `site_audit_issues(project_id=...)` to fetch technical audit findings
- Reference findings in report: "Ahrefs identified X pages with missing meta descriptions"
- Build upon them: "This analysis focuses on why content may not rank despite correct metadata"
- Combine results: Ahrefs technical issues + content/AEO gaps in single report

**If user provides no Ahrefs data:**
- Proceed with content-only analysis
- Flag in report that technical SEO was not assessed
- Focus entirely on content quality, schema, authority, and AEO readiness

### JSON-LD Extraction (CRITICAL)

**This is the core of this audit. Do not skip schema extraction.**

- **Claude Code** (Required for accurate schema analysis):
  - MUST use bash to extract JSON-LD on every page
  - Use robust Python extraction to parse and validate schema
  - Extract all `<script type="application/ld+json">` blocks
  - Validate: Schema type matches content type (FAQPage for FAQs, Article for blog posts, etc.)
  - Report specific findings: "FAQPage present but 'author' field missing" (not just "has FAQ schema")

- **Claude Web**: Schema markup is stripped during conversion
  - Not suitable for accurate schema analysis
  - Ask user to run [Google's Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results) and share output
  - OR ask user for bash output: `curl -s "https://yoursite.com" | grep "application/ld+json" -A 30`
  - Flag report: "⚠️ Schema analysis conducted via user-provided JSON-LD output"

### Analysis Boundaries

**This skill focuses on:**
- Content quality & depth
- Schema completeness & validity
- Authority & citability signals
- AEO-friendly content structure

**This skill assumes Ahrefs has checked:**
- Title tags, meta descriptions
- H1 tags, heading hierarchy
- Broken links, 404s
- Mobile optimization
- Crawlability issues

### Content Assessment Notes
- Compare content depth vs top-ranking competitors (note: requires separate research or user context)
- Flag "thin content" only if visibly <300 words for informational pages
- Assess readability for AI extraction (not readability score, but extractability)
- Don't assume technical implementation limits (e.g., "content is JS-rendered" — flag for verification)

### User Communication
**Refer to [TONE-GUIDE.md](../TONE-GUIDE.md) for tone guidelines.**

### Scope Management
- Focus on 5-20 target pages; break larger sites into batches
- This analysis is content & AEO focused (not technical SEO, backlinks, or domain metrics)
- Actual AI search ranking factors may differ from this optimization framework

## Example Interaction

**User:** "I have Ahrefs Site Audit set up. Can you analyze my content and schema?"

**Assistant:**
1. Asks: "Perfect! A few quick questions:
   - What's your Ahrefs project ID? (I can pull your audit findings automatically)
   - What are the main pages you want me to focus on (homepage, key landing pages)?
   - What does your site do? (This helps me assess if schema choices match content types)
   - Are you primarily targeting AI search engines (ChatGPT, Perplexity, etc.)?

2. Upon receiving project ID and URLs:
   - Calls Ahrefs API to fetch technical issues (titles, H1s, broken links, etc.)
   - Crawls pages to extract JSON-LD schema and content
   - Analyzes content depth, structure, authority signals
   - Assesses AEO readiness (direct answers, schema completeness, citability)
   - Generates report combining Ahrefs technical findings + content/AEO gaps
   - Provides specific schema fixes and content recommendations

**User:** "My blog posts don't rank well and AI doesn't cite my content. Can you analyze it?"

**Assistant:**
1. Asks: "Let me check your content structure and schema.
   - What's a specific page/post URL?
   - Do you have Ahrefs? If so, what's your project ID?
   - What does your blog cover?

2. Crawls the page and:
   - Checks for author info, credentials, publication date
   - Validates schema (Article? BlogPosting? Anything?)
   - Assesses if content directly answers questions or buries answers in prose
   - Checks source citations and freshness

3. If Ahrefs provided: Compares Ahrefs technical findings + content analysis

4. Generates report with gaps like:
   - "No author schema → AI can't attribute content"
   - "No schema.org metadata → AI can't extract structured data"
   - "Content lacks direct answers in opening → AI/users skip it"
   - "Statistics cited without links → Not citable"

**User:** "My site uses React and I heard it's not indexed by Google. Is that true?"

**Assistant:**
1. Asks: "Good question. Let me verify. Have you checked:
   - Google Search Console coverage report?
   - Or tried `site:yourdomain.com` in Google search?

2. If user confirms site IS indexed:
   - "Your site is indexed by Google because Googlebot executes JavaScript. However, I see crawlability gaps for other crawlers (AI answer engines, Bingbot, social media bots)."
   - Focuses audit on: static HTML schema gaps, AI-friendliness, content extractability
   - Recommends SSR/SSG for broader crawler support, not for Google indexing recovery

3. If user hasn't verified:
   - Recommends they check Search Console first
   - Still runs audit analyzing static HTML crawlability
   - Clearly distinguishes in report: "Based on static HTML analysis, content is not visible to non-JS-executing crawlers. Google indexing status should be verified in Search Console."

**User:** "I have FAQ pages but they don't show in AI responses. Can you check?"

**Assistant:**
1. Crawls FAQ pages and extracts JSON-LD
2. Finds issues like:
   - "FAQPage schema present but missing 'answer' field on 5 of 8 Q&As"
   - "Schema doesn't match visible content (claims 8 FAQs but page shows 3)"
3. Provides specific fixes:
   - "Add complete 'answer' property to each Question item in FAQPage schema"
   - "Ensure every visible FAQ is represented in schema"
4. Explains impact: "Complete FAQPage schema enables AI systems to extract and cite your Q&As in search results"

## Success Metrics

A successful audit includes:
- ✅ Ahrefs data fetched automatically (if project ID provided)
- ✅ JSON-LD extracted and validated on every page (not "no schema found" without verification)
- ✅ Clear schema gaps identified (e.g., "FAQPage schema incomplete: missing 'answer' field on X Q&As")
- ✅ Content quality issues specific to ranking/citability (e.g., "Content doesn't answer main question in first paragraph")
- ✅ Authority signal assessment (author, dates, citations present/missing)
- ✅ Specific schema/content fixes with effort estimates ("Add datePublished to Article schema: 30 minutes")
- ✅ Report integrates Ahrefs technical findings with content/AEO gaps (not duplicate analysis)
- ✅ User can act on recommendations immediately

## Edge Cases

**Scenario: User provides Ahrefs report with no content issues noted**
- Don't assume content is good; Ahrefs doesn't assess content depth or schema completeness
- Still crawl and analyze content quality independently
- Focus on schema gaps and AI-friendliness, not technical SEO

**Scenario: Pages have schema but it's incomplete**
- Don't report "schema present" as passing; specify gaps
- Example: "Article schema present but missing author, datePublished, and description fields"
- Provide exact fixes to complete schema

**Scenario: Content is JavaScript-rendered (SPA with empty static HTML)**
- Note that analysis is limited to SSR content visible in initial HTML
- **Clarify:** Modern Googlebot executes JavaScript, so the site is likely indexed by Google even with empty static HTML. However, this creates gaps for other crawlers (Bingbot, AI answer engines, social media crawlers).
- Recommend user verify actual indexing status in Google Search Console (not based on crawler simulation alone)
- Flag crawlability gaps (schema, titles, descriptions missing from static HTML) separately from indexability
- Recommend SSR/SSG as the optimization (not for Google indexing, but for AI engine crawlability and crawl efficiency)

**Scenario: Site has no schema at all**
- This is HIGH priority for AEO; provide specific schema recommendations for each content type
- Example: "Homepage needs Organization schema; blog posts need Article schema; FAQ section needs FAQPage schema"

**Scenario: User asks "is my schema valid?"**
- Don't just say "valid" or "invalid"
- Provide specific assessment: "Schema structure is valid but missing 3 required properties: author, datePublished, image"
- Recommend user run [Google's Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results) for official validation
